# High Protein Recipes Website

This is the first project I created as part of **[The Odin Project's Full Stack Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**.

## About the Project
This simple website showcases a collection of high-protein recipes sourced from Hunter Micheletto's *Shredz Macro Masterpiece Cookbook*.

### Features:
- Displays recipes with detailed information.
- Focuses on elementary HTML and CSS skills.

## Acknowledgements
- [Hunter Micheletto](https://www.hunt4shredz.com/) for the *Shredz Macro Masterpiece Cookbook* from which the recipes and images have been taken.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for the curriculum and guidance.
